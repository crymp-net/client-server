/**
 * Automatizes management of debris pieces' lifespan.
 *
 * Anyone who needs to use Entity-based debris can add the pieces here after
 * spawning and basically stop caring about it.
 *
 * Supports setting resource-usage policy.  The resources available to control
 * are expiration time and maximum number of debris pieces in the system at any
 * given time.  Expiration time can be controlled by setting minimum and
 * maximum expiration times or by setting it to "never expire" mode.
 *
 * Max number of debris pieces is treated separately from expiration.  I.e.
 * both expiring mode with unlimited list and non-expiring mode with limit on
 * list size are conceivable.
 *
 * The caller can set debris lifetime upon submitting it to DebrisMgr, or he
 * can leave it up to the DebrisMgr to determine the lifetime according to
 * a policy.  Note that if expiration policy is set to "never expire", any
 * caller supplied expiration times are ignored.  This is to make it possible
 * to switch the whole system between expiring and non-expiring modes just by
 * a single to call to DebrisMgr.
 *
 * Note that policy setting interface is designed to be used once, at the start
 * of the program.  If policy is reset after pieces of debris have already
 * been added, the behavior is not well defined (but basically, the new policy
 * will only affect newly added pieces).
