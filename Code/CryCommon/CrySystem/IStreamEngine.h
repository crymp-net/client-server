// This is the prototypes of interfaces that will be used for asynchronous
// I/O (streaming).
// THIS IS NOT FINAL AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE

// Some excerpts explaining basic ideas behind streaming design here:

/*
 * The idea is that the data loaded is ready for usage and ideally doesn't need further transformation,
 * therefore the client allocates the buffer (to avoid extra copy). All the data transformations should take place in the Resource Compiler. If you have to allocate a lot of small memory objects, you should revise this strategy in favor of one big allocation (again, that will be read directly from the compiled file).
 * Anyway, we can negotiate that the streaming engine allocates this memory.
 * In the end, it could make use of a memory pool, and copying data is not the bottleneck in our engine
 *
 * The client should take care of all fast operations. Looking up file size should be fast on the virtual
 * file system in a pak file, because the directory should be preloaded in memory

// Description:
//  CryPak supports asynchronous reading through this interface. The callback 
//  is called from the main thread in the frame update loop.
//
//  The callback receives packets through StreamOnComplete() and 
//  StreamOnProgress(). The second one can be used to update the asset based 
//  on the partial data that arrived. the callback that will be called by the 
//  streaming engine must be implemented by all clients that want to use 
//  StreamingEngine services
//
// Remarks:
//  the pStream interface is guaranteed to be locked (have reference count > 0)
//  while inside the function, but can vanish any time outside the function.
//  If you need it, keep it from the beginning (after call to StartRead())
//  some or all callbacks MAY be called from inside IStreamEngine::StartRead()
// 
// Example:
// <code>
// IStreamEngine *pStreamEngine = g_pISystem->GetStreamEngine();	 // get streaming engine
// IStreamCallback *pCallback = &MyClass;									// user
// 
// StreamReadParams params;
// 
// params.dwUserData = 0;
// params.nSize = 0;
// params.pBuffer = nullptr;
// params.nLoadTime = 10000;
// params.nMaxLoadTime = 10000;
// params.nFlags |= SRP_FLAGS_ASYNC_PROGRESS;
// 
// pStreamEngine->StartRead(  .. pCallback .. params .. );			 // registers callback
// </code>
