===============================================================================
              + Added feature or noticable improvement
              - Bug fix or something removed
              * Changed or Information
              ! Important!
===============================================================================

5/11/09 4.29.01
----------------------------------------------------
* Conflicting event properties, such as when '3D Min distance' is greater than
  '3D Max distance' or '3D Cone Inside Angle' is greater than
  '3D Cone Outside Angle', now cause build errors and are highlighted in the 
  Event property editor


21/10/09 4.29.00
----------------------------------------------------
+ Added event editor option to audition oneshot events repeatedly
+ Added 'ignore pre- and post-build commands' command line options: '-k' and
  '-K' respectively
+ Events are now shown with simple/complex badges: a green 'S' for simple
  events and a red 'C' for complex events
+ Event groups are now flagged in the event hierarchy with a red 'C' badge
  if they contain any complex events
+ Simple events' Oneshot property is now disabled for editing, as it is
  overridden by the event's sound instance

+ Profiler - Added ability to see snapshots of the peak volume for each DSP
             node, per channel

- Fixed "Pitch randomisation units" and "Pitch units" properties being
  overwritten by templates when properties are unlocked
- Fixed FMOD_ERR_EVENT_MISMATCH when project is partially built from multiple
  different directories

- Profiler - Spread out DSP input connections so any duplicates are more visible

* Event layers can now be selected by clicking on empty spaces in the layer
  control
* NOTE: You should rebuild *all* wavebanks in your projects to avoid
        FMOD_ERR_EVENT_MISMATCH errors after upgrading to this build. You only
        have to do this once.
