What is the difference between fmodex.dll? and fmodexp.dll?

FMODEX.DLL
----------
This DLL is FMOD Ex with all codecs, dsp effects and output modes statically compiled 
into the dll.
This means you can use all the features of FMOD without needing extra plugins 
accompanying your application.  
The DLL is bigger because of this.

FMODEXP.DLL
-----------
This DLL is FMOD Ex with all codecs, dsp units and output modes loaded at run-time
as dynamic plugins instead of being statically compiled into the dll.  
Plugins in the plugins/ directory need to be used to support all of FMOD Ex's features.
Use this if you want a smaller distribution and only need one file format support 
for example (ie .WAV).
The DLL is smaller because of this.
